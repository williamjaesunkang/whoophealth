"""# Conclusion
Through analyzing the data we were able to find significant trends by using differing techniques. The most significant of these was the September recovery week to week. It was clear that on the weekends recovery was significantly lower than the recovery on the weekdays. This was most likely due to the people in the dataset had higher levels of drinking that usually take place. Another takeaway from the data is that a higher skin temperature correlated with lower HRV (heart rate variability) causing a lower recovery. Another conclusion we came to was that a higher skin temperature when sleeping lead to a lower amount of time in REM sleep. Also higher blood oxygen levels lead to a longer amount of time spent in REM sleep. Using these findings one can see how to get the best recovery and sleep which was lowering drinking, lowering the temperature of your room and that more sleep usually leads to the largest increase in light sleep over over types of sleep.
